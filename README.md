Bc Tweaks | BC Admin Ui. v1.1
=============================

Simple Ui to help with consistency of BC App Development look and feel. This is purely a replica of the BC styles with some additions, tweaks and some goodies.

There are a set of files to get you started.

See all comments in the files themselves.

The files are provided for you as a "Micro-framework". modify, add, change, remove as you see fit. But more importantly - Share - with the rest of us.

Everything provided is as structured and commented as possible for you so you can find your way around.

If you find something that may be done differently for better performance or structure, do not hesitate to contribute.

Implementation of API of any sort is not included. This is purely design styling for all BC partners to work with.

Compatibility Tests done on: Mac OSX v10.9.1 with Google Chrome v33. Please make your own compatibility tests for other browsers, devices and OS.

The Ui has been tested in Chrome only at this stage. We will make further compatibility testings in the next version.

In the mean time, please make sure everything works for you in supported browsers.
